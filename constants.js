    It is an annual hackathon and pitching competition hosted by the TiC foundation with the main aim of fostering creativity amongst secondary school students by giving them a chance to present projects on various topics ranging from Artificial intelligence to rocket science and why not even space technology.
    ---
You’re not the best student in your class but you have that one idea to solve any problem in your society, family, or just in your study space? Problems related to topics like learning(education), health, sanitation, renewable energy, artifacts, climate change, or economic development. Even ideas for entertainment are welcome since our aim is to foster creativity amongst children.
---
The best projects are selected for three days of intensive training at the 3D printing center, the most advanced high-tech center in central and west Africa under the National Advanced School of Polytechnics of the university of Yaounde I.
---
These teams are further taken to the ICT University of Yaounde where there is a final pitching competition with some renowned CEOs in Cameroon as the judges.
---
Join a team of like-minded students and equally the most intelligent kids in the country with whom you would rub your minds and possibly spend some time while lodging in one of the best hotels in Yaounde.
